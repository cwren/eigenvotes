The vote space is a high-dimensional space representing all the
possible votes on a set of actions.  A candidate occupies a point in
this space, defined by the vector constructed of thier votes.  A
matrix of votes is created by stacking the candidates, forming a matrix
of votes arrayed by candidate crossed by action.  Since we cannot
visual a hundred-dimensional space, it is necessary to find a
projection of these votes into a subspace that we can visualize.  The
the singular value decomposition is computed for the matrix to find
the linear 2D subspace that capture the greatest variation in the
data.  Each candidate is projected through this transform into the 2D
space defined by the two most significant singular values.  The
candidates are then charted in this eigenvote space.

All votes are considered, not just the final vote on a bill, or the
votes on "important" bills.  All votes have an impact on the
conversation occurring in Washington D.C., so when determining how a
candidate votes, all votes should be considered.

First, to download the voting records, you must edit scan.py to add
your votesmart key, then

./scan.py

To pivot on a representative, find their votesmart candidate ID (for
example, Senator Scott Brown is 18919), then project all
representatives with significant overlapping votes into a common 2D space:

./eigenvotes.py 18919

Load the output into a spreadsheet, and chart to taste.
